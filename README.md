# 🌐 HTML Projects Collection

Welcome to my HTML Projects Repository!  
This repo contains a collection of beginner to intermediate-level HTML projects that I’ve built while learning and practicing web development.

Each project focuses on using **pure HTML** (with some CSS if needed) to develop and structure web pages.
